**👩🏻‍💻 Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis**

An End-to-End Data Analytics Project

This project demonstrates a complete analytics workflow using Python, SQL, and Power BI. It covers everything from understanding raw customer transaction data to generating business insights and building a final dashboard.

It is ideal for:

Students or professionals practicing Python + SQL + Power BI

Anyone preparing for Data Analyst / Data Scientist interviews

Learners who want a portfolio-ready end-to-end project

📌 Project Summary

The project is built on a dataset of 3,900 customer purchase records. The goal is to analyze shopping patterns, customer segments, product performance, and spending behavior.

The workflow includes:

✅ 1. Python: Data Cleaning & EDA

Loaded and explored the dataset

Fixed missing ratings

Standardized column names

Created new fields such as age groups and purchase frequency

Connected Python to PostgreSQL for storing cleaned data

✅ 2. SQL: Business Analysis

Using PostgreSQL, SQL queries were written to answer important business questions such as:

Which gender contributes most to revenue?

Which products have the best average ratings?

Do subscribers spend more than non-subscribers?

Which items rely most on discounts?

Who are new, returning, and loyal customers?

What are the top-selling products in each category?

✅ 3. Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was built to visualize:

Revenue by demographics

Customer segments

Product categories

Discount usage and purchase patterns

Age group spending trends

✅ 4. Final Insights & Recommendations

Based on the analysis, clear insights and business suggestions were prepared, such as improving loyalty programs, promoting high-rated products, and optimizing discount strategies.
